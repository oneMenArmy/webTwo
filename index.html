							you’ll interact with animals both hostile and benign and witness a true ecosystem with natural checks and balances in action. 
							And in this system, you’ll be the apex predator. Clear out the monsters infesting a region, or eradicate a nest to rid an area of

							Witcher’s Signs, another set of skills in Geralt’s repertoire, are powerful combat spells that take various forms, 
							from protective barriers, through torrents of flame, to magic snares and more. Lastly there is Geralt’s wolf medallion, 
							the symbol of his witcher school. This pendant hums to alert him of nearby magic and monsters -- invaluable help to a monster 
							hunter. Most of these skills can be developed for additional effects and increased potency, making Geralt 
							an even more fearsome fighter.</p>

							magical attacks, thereby delaying the witcher’s own demise, while potent blade oils and bombs give him an 
							extra edge in combat. Thanks to his training in alchemy, Geralt can gather rare herbs along his path and 
							use them to brew special, highly toxic concoctions. His potions would kill any ordinary human, but Geralt’s 
							mutations let him metabolize them. They grant him abilities that include seeing in the dark, moving faster, 
							striking with added force… and much, much more.</p>

								monsters is his business -- and there’s always plenty of work. Monsters
								come in all shapes and sizes, and while some are members of broader
								species, others are one -of-a-kind. To face the latter, extremely
								powerful or clever creatures, you’ll embark on special quests to learn

								The monster threat is real and strong. Along your path you’ll encounter

								there gone. Should you decide to risk death, your job will be to

			<p class="game-info">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[a] is a 2015 action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. 
				Based on The Witcher series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, it is the sequel to the 2011 
				game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. Played in an open world with a third-person perspective, players 
				control protagonist Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher, who is looking for his missing
